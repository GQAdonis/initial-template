# PowerSync Database

The ONE Application leverages PowerSync to provide a robust offline-first database synchronization solution. This technology enables seamless operation across multiple devices, even without constant internet connectivity, while maintaining data consistency and security.

## What is PowerSync?

PowerSync is a bi-directional synchronization layer specifically designed to keep a local SQLite database in sync with a remote PostgreSQL database. It provides:

- True offline-first capabilities
- Real-time data synchronization
- Conflict resolution
- Efficient delta-based updates
- Security and access control

## PowerSync in the ONE Application

In our architecture, PowerSync serves as the critical bridge between client applications and the server-side Supabase PostgreSQL database:

### PowerSync Server

The PowerSync Server is a dedicated component that:

- Monitors the PostgreSQL database for changes
- Manages client connections and authentication
- Streams changes to connected clients
- Processes updates from clients
- Handles conflict resolution

### Client Integration

On the client side (Tauri application), PowerSync:

- Maintains a local SQLite database
- Provides a familiar SQL interface for queries
- Handles offline data storage and queuing
- Synchronizes with the server when connectivity is available
- Manages data conflicts according to defined rules

## Advantages for AI Applications

PowerSync provides several key advantages for the ONE Application's AI capabilities:

### Continuous Operation

- AI agents can function without constant internet connectivity
- Users can interact with AI assistants even when offline
- Work continues seamlessly during connectivity interruptions
- Background synchronization when connectivity is restored

### Cross-Device Consistency

- Conversations and context are synchronized across all user devices
- AI agents maintain consistent state regardless of access point
- User preferences and settings are always up-to-date
- Seamless transition between desktop, web, and mobile experiences

### Performance Optimization

- Local database queries are extremely fast
- Reduced latency for AI interactions
- Bandwidth-efficient delta-based synchronization
- Reduced server load through local processing

### Data Resilience

- Multiple copies of data prevent loss
- Automatic recovery from synchronization failures
- Historical data is preserved for context
- Backup and restore capabilities

## Technical Implementation

The PowerSync implementation in the ONE Application consists of several key components:

### Database Schema

The database schema is designed to support AI agent operations, including:

- User profiles and preferences
- Conversation history and context
- AI agent configurations and state
- Knowledge bases and reference materials
- Generated content and artifacts

### Synchronization Rules

PowerSync is configured with specific synchronization rules that:

- Prioritize user-generated content for immediate sync
- Handle conflicts by preserving both versions when appropriate
- Limit synchronization scope based on user permissions
- Optimize bandwidth usage for large datasets

### Security Model

The security model ensures that:

- Data is encrypted both at rest and in transit
- Authentication is required for synchronization
- Row-level security controls access to shared data
- Sensitive information is properly protected

## Use Cases

PowerSync enables several powerful use cases for the ONE Application:

### Seamless Multi-Device Experience

Users can start a conversation with an AI agent on their desktop, continue it on their phone while commuting, and pick up exactly where they left off on their tablet at home.

### Collaborative AI Projects

Multiple users can collaborate on AI-assisted projects, with changes synchronizing between all participants in real-time, even when some users are temporarily offline.

### Resilient AI Assistants

AI assistants remain functional during internet outages, maintaining context and capabilities, and seamlessly reconnecting when connectivity is restored.

### Bandwidth-Efficient Operation

Users in bandwidth-constrained environments can work with AI assistants without constant data transfer, with synchronization occurring efficiently when connectivity is available.

## Integration with Other Components

PowerSync works in concert with other system components:

### AT Protocol Integration

- User identity from AT Protocol is used for authentication
- Shared content can be synchronized across devices
- Social interactions are preserved in the local database

### IPFS Integration

- Large files and content are stored in IPFS
- References to IPFS content are synchronized via PowerSync
- Efficient handling of binary data and media

### AI Agent Orchestration

- Agent state and context are synchronized
- Learning and adaptation are preserved across sessions
- Personalization settings follow the user across devices
