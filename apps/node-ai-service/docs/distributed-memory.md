# Distributed Memory Systems

The ONE Application incorporates a custom Graphiti server with SurrealDB support to enable powerful distributed memory systems. This integration complements the existing pgvector-based RAG capabilities in Supabase and creates a comprehensive knowledge management ecosystem that's available anywhere, on any device, tied to a user's decentralized identifier in the AT Protocol.

## Graphiti Server with SurrealDB

### What is Graphiti?

Graphiti is a custom-built graph database server that has been adapted to work with SurrealDB instead of the traditional Neo4j backend. This adaptation provides several key advantages:

- **Document-Graph Hybrid Model**: SurrealDB combines document database flexibility with graph database relationship capabilities
- **Rust-Based Performance**: Built on Rust for high performance and memory safety
- **Distributed Architecture**: Designed from the ground up for distributed environments
- **Multi-Model Flexibility**: Supports document, graph, and relational models in a single database

### GraphRAG Capabilities

The integration of Graphiti with SurrealDB enables sophisticated GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities:

- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Automatically builds and maintains knowledge graphs from diverse data sources
- **Relationship-Aware Retrieval**: Considers relationships between entities when retrieving information
- **Context-Rich Generation**: Provides LLMs with richer context based on graph relationships
- **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: Enables complex reasoning across multiple connected concepts
- **Structured Knowledge Representation**: Organizes information in a way that mirrors human cognitive processes

## Edge AI and Distributed Memory

The combination of PowerSync, AT Protocol, IPFS, and Graphiti with SurrealDB creates a powerful distributed memory system that enables true edge AI capabilities:

### Personal Knowledge Graph

Each user has their own personal knowledge graph that:

- Captures their unique understanding and perspectives
- Grows and evolves based on their interactions and learning
- Reflects their personal and professional interests
- Preserves context across different conversations and domains

### Decentralized Access

The distributed memory system ensures that a user's knowledge and memories are:

- Available on any device they use
- Accessible even without constant internet connectivity
- Synchronized efficiently when connectivity is available
- Secured through decentralized identity verification

### Hyperpersonalization

The combination of distributed memory and AT Protocol's decentralized identity enables unprecedented levels of personalization:

- AI interactions that truly understand the user's context and history
- Personalized recommendations based on comprehensive knowledge
- Adaptive interfaces that evolve with the user's preferences
- Consistent experience across all touchpoints

### PowerSync Synchronization

PowerSync ensures that the distributed memory is synchronized across devices:

- Efficient delta-based updates for graph structures
- Conflict resolution for concurrent changes
- Background synchronization when connectivity is available
- Prioritization of critical memory components

### AT Protocol Identity Binding

The user's AT Protocol decentralized identifier (DID) serves as the anchor for their distributed memory:

- Secure authentication and authorization
- Portable identity across different services
- Granular control over memory sharing
- Federation with other users and communities

### IPFS Content Storage

IPFS provides efficient storage for the content referenced in the memory graph:

- Content-addressable storage for immutable references
- Distributed resilience for critical memories
- Efficient sharing of common knowledge
- Versioning and history tracking

## Use Cases
