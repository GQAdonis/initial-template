```

The architecture consists of:

1. **Application Container** - The outer shell that manages navigation and workspace switching
2. **Primary Navigation** - Persistent sidebar for switching between workspaces
3. **Workspace Canvas** - The main content area that adapts to the active workspace
4. **Mobile Navigation** - Bottom bar navigation for smaller screens

## Key Workspaces

Prometheus includes four primary workspaces, each optimized for specific functions:

### 1. Chat

The Chat workspace is the primary interface for conversational AI interactions:

- Rich markdown rendering with support for code, math, diagrams, and media
- Context management for knowledge base integration
- Advanced content interaction for copying, exporting, and editing
- Desktop-specific enhancements for advanced rendering and file attachments

### 2. Library

The Library workspace serves as a knowledge management system:

- Organization of information into collections and hierarchies
- Support for various document types and formats
- Vector search and retrieval powered by embedding models
- Seamless integration with chat conversations

### 3. Image Generation

The Image Generation workspace provides AI-driven image creation:

- Text-to-image generation with fine-grained control
- Image-to-image transformation capabilities
- Comprehensive image management with IPFS storage
- Integration with other workspaces for contextual image creation

### 4. Settings

The Settings workspace offers comprehensive configuration options:

- AI model management across the application
- Secure API key storage and usage tracking
- User interface personalization
- Advanced technical configuration for power users

## Additional Features

Beyond the core workspaces, Prometheus includes several cross-cutting features:

### Social Sharing
